# Supabase CRUD POC with React

This project is a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Postgres) as a backend with a React.js frontend for basic CRUD operations.

## Features

- React.js frontend for interacting with Supabase
- Basic Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality
- Simple project setup for learning and experimentation
- **Row Level Security (RLS) is disabled** for simplicity

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Supabase account

### Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a Supabase project and note your API keys.
4. Update the Supabase credentials in your React app (usually in `.env` or config files).
5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Notes

- **RLS is disabled** in the Supabase project for ease of use. **Do not use this setup in production.**
